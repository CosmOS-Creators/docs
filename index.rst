.. Important::

    The pre-alpha version provides early access to new features and research phase of development in exchange for the promise you will document and
    report issues and give feedback to help make the CosmOS better. Do not join the pre-alpha program if you are not comfortable with
    running software that is not well tested and may have bugs or incomplete features.
