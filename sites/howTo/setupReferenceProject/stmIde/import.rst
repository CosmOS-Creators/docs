Import
=============================

This page will provide you with information about how to import the reference project into the STM32 Cube IDE.

Prerequisites
--------------

- Locally installed `STM32 Cube IDE 1.5.1 <https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html>`_


First time STM32 Cube IDE project import
----------------------------------------
#. First of all you have to run the following commands in your local directory for cloning the reference project:
    .. code-block::

            git clone https://github.com/CosmOS-Creators/reference_project_stmIDE.git . --recurse-submodules
            git submodule foreach git checkout master
#. After cloning the reference project we open the STM32 Cube IDE and go to the menu option :menuselection:`File --> Open Projects from File System`.
    .. image:: ../../../../images/stmIde/import_project_stmIde.png
        :alt: Open projects from file system
#. Then a window *Import Projects from File System or Archive* will show up and we click on the highlighted button **Directory**. The file explorer window will show up and we point to the reference project directory and press the button **Select Folder**.

#. After this point we just click on the button **Finish** and STM32 Cube IDE will import the whole nested project structure.

#. If the project import was successful we will see the reference_project_stmIDE in the Project Explorer on the left side of the STM32 Cube IDE.

#. In the end we have to ensure that the projects for the both cores are converted to the C++ language. We highlight the core one by one and check if there is an option to convert it to C++, if it was not already done.
