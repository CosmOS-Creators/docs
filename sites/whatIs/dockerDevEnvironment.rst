Docker dev environment
=============================
Dev Environments enable you to collaborate easily by allowing you to share work-in-progress code with your team members. When using Dev Environments, you can easily set up repeatable development environments, keeping the environment details versioned along with your code. You can also share your work-in-progress code with your team members in just one click and without having to deal with any merge conflicts while moving between Git branches to get your code on to their machine.

Dev Environments also allow you to switch between your developer environments or your team membersâ€™ environments, move between branches to look at changes that are in progress, without moving off your current Git branch.
