Motivation
=============================

- CosmOS is an open-source project that we have initiated since the year 2020. We aim to create a hybrid operating system that offers performance and safety features within one system.
- The CosmOS architecture also allows the generation of all configuration code by model descriptions to increase productivity, make code portable, and enforce consistency.
- We created a set of tools with a graphical user interface to help users with the CosmOS deployment, consisting of configuration, validation, and code generation.
- It also supports the C/C++ language with the dynamic allocation and allow users to develop more complex algorithms.
- We developed CosmOS according to safety-critical design principles and coding best practices and we will strive to enhance the overall quality and safety of the software within the future releases.
