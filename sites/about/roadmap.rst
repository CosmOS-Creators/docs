Roadmap
=============================

What is the roadmap about?
---------------------------
A roadmap is a strategic plan that defines a goal or desired outcome and includes the major steps or milestones needed to reach it.
It also serves as a communication tool, a high-level document that helps articulate strategic thinking—the why—behind both the goal and the plan for getting there.
