Main features
=============================
We implemented multiple safety concepts to ensure it offers safety and performance features.

The following list contains the main features of the CosmOS and CustomBox:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The CustomBox GUI helps users with configuration, deployment, and generation of the code for the core, integration, and application layers
- Support for multi-core microcontrollers
- Hybrid scheduling combines the complex real-time non-preemptive scheduling and the multi-threading preemptive scheduling
- Memory mapping and memory protection of tasks/threads stacks, user program heaps, and user program data
- Memory manager supports thread-safe dynamic allocations
- System-User safe data transfers
- Inter-Core safe data transfers
- Configurable tasks/threads permissions for data transfers
- Configurable system jobs with inner scheduling for the drivers
- Configurable synchronization primitives
- Highly portable and modular design, which is easy to port and expand
