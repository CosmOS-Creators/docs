Main features
=============================
We implemented multiple safety concepts to ensure it offers safety and performance features.

The following list contains the main features of the CosmOS and CustomBox:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The CustomBox GUI helps users with configuration, generation and deployment.
- Support for multi-core microcontrollers.
- Hybrid scheduling combines the cyclic real-time non-preemptive scheduling and the multi-threading preemptive scheduling.
- Memory mapping and memory protection of tasks/threads stacks, user program heaps, and user program data.
- Memory manager supports thread-safe dynamic allocations.
- Inter-program safe data transfers.
- Configurable tasks/threads permissions for data transfers.
- Possibility to implement drivers in application layer with configurable peripheral access.
- Modular kernel expansion by system jobs with inner scheduling.
- Configurable synchronization primitives.
- Highly portable and modular design, which is easy to port and expand.
