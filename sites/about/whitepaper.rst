Whitepaper
=============================
The CosmOS whitepaper is the informational document issued by us (CosmOS Creators)
to highlight the features of the solution we developed. It contains the general introduction
into the project composed of the motivation, architecture, main features, and workflow sections.
Then we covered technical solutions for each of the CosmOS's software layers. In the end we
described parts of the CosmOS CustomBox GUI.
